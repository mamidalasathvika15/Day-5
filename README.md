# Day-5 
# 🚀 Decision Trees and Random Forests on Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Objective  
Learn and implement tree-based models for classification using the Titanic dataset.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib (for plotting feature importances)  

---

## 📈 Project Workflow  

1. **Train a Decision Tree Classifier**  
   - Train on Titanic dataset features to predict survival  
   - Visualize the decision tree structure  

2. **Analyze Overfitting and Control Tree Depth**  
   - Experiment with tree depth to prevent overfitting  
   - Compare training and test accuracies for different depths  

3. **Train a Random Forest Classifier**  
   - Train ensemble model with multiple trees  
   - Compare accuracy with Decision Tree  

4. **Interpret Feature Importances**  
   - Extract and plot feature importance from Random Forest  

5. **Evaluate Using Cross-Validation**  
   - Use k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and performance

## 📊 Output & Results  
- Decision Tree and Random Forest accuracies  
- Visualization of decision tree (text-based or plot)  
- Feature importance bar chart  
- Cross-validation accuracy scores
